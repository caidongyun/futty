I'm just the guy behind [FuTTY](http://code.google.com/p/futty/).. I've been using other forks of PuTTY for years, and they never seemed to have all the features I liked and they would always become outdated (out of sync with the official PuTTY).. So that's why I made FuTTY..to put in all the features I want, and to keep it up to date with the official [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) (in [SVN](http://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/putty/)).

I still don't consider myself a C programmer, although I do have programming experience in other languages.  I can read and reshuffle C code well enough to mix in other peoples patches and write small features of my own though. =)
